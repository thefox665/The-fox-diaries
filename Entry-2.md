The Fox Diaries — Itaewon Café

I’m finally sitting here with my iced americano, the one I’ve been craving since the last hour of my shift. My whole body is tired in that “I’ve been on my feet all day” way, but honestly the second I walked out of the pub I already knew where I was going. The girls knew too. The moment I said “I’m going to my café,” they all gave me that look — the “go see your crush and report back immediately” look.

They’re literally waiting for a picture of him. My phone keeps buzzing in the group chat like I’m some undercover agent on a mission. I feel like an idiot smiling to myself while pretending I’m just here to study or write, but I’m not fooling anyone. Not them, not me.

The café feels comforting tonight. Cold air, warm lights, the usual background noise. I’m tired, but in a good way — the kind of tired where your brain feels soft and open and you can actually breathe.

And yes, part of me is just hoping he’s here. That stupid little thrill of possibly seeing his face after a long day. Even if it’s only for five seconds. Even if I don’t say anything.

Anyway… I’m here. I’m writing. I’m doing my little routine. And somewhere out there, my coworkers are refreshing their phones waiting for “the pic.”

Honestly? It’s kind of funny. And kind of cute.
