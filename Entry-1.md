Seoul, Winter 2025

I’ve been in Seoul for a few months now, and the city has already changed me in ways I didn’t expect. I came here for language school, for adventure, for the version of myself I always felt was waiting somewhere past the edge of my comfort zone. What I didn’t realize was how quickly this place would start feeling like home — the cafés with their warm lights, the late-night streets in Itaewon, the quiet subway rides where I stare at my reflection and think, I did it. I’m really here.

The last months weren’t perfect. I had moments of loneliness, small victories, crushes that made my heart race, nights where I felt brave, and days where I felt completely lost. I studied, I worked, I got hurt (literally sliced my thumb open like a K-drama side character), I healed, I explored, I got on Bumble, I met people, I missed people, and somewhere in all that chaos… I realized I needed a place to write.

Not a pretty Instagram caption.
Not a long message to a friend.
A place that’s mine — where I can catch all the little pieces of my Seoul life before they disappear.

So this is it.
The Fox Diaries.

A digital journal of everything I’m living, learning, feeling, and becoming in this city. The small moments, the big ones, the crushes, the courage, the fear, the wins, the heartbreaks, the neon lights, the rain, the language mistakes, the unexpected tenderness — all of it.

If future me ever reads this, I hope she smiles.
Because right now? I’m in the middle of becoming her.
