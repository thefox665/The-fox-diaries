My little heart feels heavy tonight.  
So small, yet somehow it carries oceans — so much to give, with no one steady enough to receive it.

This week felt almost ordinary for a heart like mine. I gathered as much courage as a 90% introvert can gather, and I walked toward my little fox den — my favourite coffee shop, the place that feels like home, the place where my favourite barista exists in the same air as me.  
The plan was simple: take one brave step, offer him my number, offer him a piece of my raw, beating heart.

Instead, my eyes landed on another girl standing in his personal space… and everything inside me froze.

And what does a 90% introvert do after a moment like that?  
They retreat.  
They fold into their shell.  
Confidence on the floor, heart bleeding quietly.

Now it’s Friday, and I’m sitting in a different café, because my legs couldn’t carry me all the way to him — even though my treacherous little heart tried. I saw his face through the window, and my whole body walked away on instinct.

So here I am instead: a quiet corner, a new spot, loud thoughts, and an even louder heartbeat. Writing again. Trying to make sense of this heavy little heart of mine.
